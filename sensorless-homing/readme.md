# Y Homing Stop

On my build, the Y homing was about -25mm from the print origin, and the BLTouch mount I used was hitting the LED/Neopixel mount on the bed frame when homing.  This spacer is put on the front of X/Y Stepper so that the Y homes about -5mm from the origin and prevents the BLTouch mount from hitting other components.
