# Center Punch Guides for Extrusions

Printable guides for using a center punch in 20 series extrusions.  These are tight in my extrusions both in the channel and against my center punch tip so that the punch is as accurate in the channel as possible.

## Side Extrusions (bottom and top) (measured from the front)

30mm & 50mm is for the 2040 blind joint access if using 3z mod (https://wiki.layerfused.com/en/printers/mods/johanmalay/3-z-screw-conversion) with 20mm setback

50mm & 70mm is for the 2040 blind joint access if using 3z mod (https://wiki.layerfused.com/en/printers/mods/johanmalay/3-z-screw-conversion) with 40mm setback

170mm & 190mm is for the 2040 blind joint access for the default build

## 3z rear 2020 (measured from either side)

200mm is for centering the third z vertical 2020. (if using a 2040 for the thrid z vertical, should be able to use 190 from both sides)

## Bed Frame

150mm for centering the standard H frame 

10mm for end extrusions if using the 6+2 point mod (https://wiki.layerfused.com/en/printers/mods/johanmalay/8-point-bed-mount)

## All others joining at corners
